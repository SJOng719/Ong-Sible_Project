# Project Title: Todoist 

•	This is an app that helps people who are unorganized and don't find the time to write down what they have to do and feel that day. It's a program that can help people show their calendars, organize & write down their duties for the day and write down their mood.

# Problem Statement: There are people who have unorganized schedules, having an unorganized schedule could lead to forgetting important occasions or having clashing events. You can list tasks in advance and allot time for each task and the app will remind you to do it. Let's not forget that some don't find the time to write down what they feel that day, sometimes you just need someone to ask how you're doing.

# Project Objectives: 
•	To help users organize and track their daily tasks and events with reminders.
•	To encourage self-awareness through daily mood tracking and reflections.
•	To improve time management by displaying clear schedules and preventing overlapping activities.

# Project Features:
•	Displays calendar - Allows you to note important events (with reminder for if you need to prepare and if you need to make sure your events won't overlap)
•	Mood tracker - Asks how you’re doing, and keeps track of your mood 
•	Displays a list of tasks - You will be able to organize things you need to complete for the day
